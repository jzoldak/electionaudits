ToDo list for ElectionAudits   http://neal.mcburnett.org/electionaudits/

Questions
=========
Is median right in varsize.print_precinct_stats()?  Why?  Only sorted in Contest.select_units()?

Bugs
====
Fix bug: missing final audit unit - problem with flushpipes?
 worked to parse the last line, followed by a line I didn't care about
  the latter line caused new contest to be registered, with zero votes

Why no negative alert for  j001_mb_052.xml after p287_mb_735.xml ?

Fix "ballots to audit" for contests that allow multiple votes

Parse different kinds of csv: Hart, San Mateo County, Lindeman csvs - need new option?


Kaplan-Markoff
==============
Implement kaplan-markoff with ppeb sampling
 http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1443314
 /srv/voting/audit/stark-kaplan-markoff-ssrn-id1443314.pdf

Mark Lindeman example:
 A Kaplan-Markov auditing example using 2008 California data - Mark Lindeman, 1/10/2010 (v. 1.2, 1/13/2010)
 /home/srv/voting/audit/kaplan-example-1.2.pdf
  and https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B2nDnxGP_08mZjY2NGJlNmMtZTM0Ni00NjExLWFkNjUtNzgwZDhmN2U0NmQx&hl=en

Get error bounds right - in Contest.tally()?
 Calculate error bounds by batch based on results for loser

 add u-value (maximum possible reduction in margin) and discrepancy for each audit unit to model
 Or just decrease in margin, by contest?
 record for every loseer (every margin) or just max?

 generate ppeb audit unit selections, and note possibility of multiple selections - change "selected" to be an integer??

 switch margin to integer, not percent?
 confidence ==> float?

Add code for discrepancies:
 Record hand counts - possibly more than one?  perhaps add a type and number to VoteCount? (machine vs hand count; sequence number)

 how to decide how many to select if we're a fraction of the whole?

 later:
 add election definition stuff like "vote for 1" and refine winners/losers
 parse "vote for n" rules on who wins
 handle races with classes of winner, like boulder council: 4 4-year winners, one 2-year winner

Implement macro auditing (stark)

What info is needed to determine error bound in vote-for-2 race?  undervotes??

Testing
=======
Make tests more robust.
E.g. need floating point fuzz? 

Testing bug in   manage.py test electionaudits.TestT0
 testdata/t0/reports.html St Vrain Negexp ballots: 23 on my machine, 22 on Aaron's windows box

Note that changing how merging and parsing is done can change audit unit numbers, contestbatch ids, urls to contestbatch notes,
and perhaps even how to select stuff in test cases

E.g. test case changes for revno 66 2010-10-25:
different batch seq, random and priority for ../testdata/t0/selections-4.html
-   <td>000006</td>
+   <td>000008</td>
    <td>0.907125</td>
-   <td>0.189911</td>
-   <td>4.776582</td>
+   <td>0.966987</td>
+   <td>0.938094</td>

?

../testdata/t0/results.html diff: 
 -<li> Votes audited: 80
 +<li> Votes audited: 55

-   <td><a href="../admin/electionaudits/contestbatch/109/">None</a></td>
+   <td><a href="../admin/electionaudits/contestbatch/102/">None</a></td>

etc.  looks like manual selection of contestbatch 109 might be picking up a different one than before??

prev    file:///srv/s/electionaudits/trunk/testdata/t0/results.html  == STATE SENATE - DISTRICT 17  "p008_lat_ed_001 p014_lat_ed_002 p011_lat_ed_003"
current http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/electionaudits/contestbatch/109/ == amend 56, p011_lat_ed_003:ED
  other is now #102 - why?

Interface, Usability
====================

Features
========
Generate a pivot table of preference tendencies by precincts vs contests

Support multiple databases, or at least multiple elections, managed by one person

Address confusion over why audit units aren't sequential, due to combining of units.  List all unit numbers along with batch ids?

Add a /favicon.ico

Unclassified
============
Provide a way to specify which audit units should be combined, and how to renumber them.
Note: for interoperability and reproducability between different software
auditing applications, the combining/merging rules need to be the same, to
the point where they end up with the same sequence numbers for all audit units.

Fix bug "server error" 500 on contest with no audit units, e.g. boulder primary 2010 COUNTY SHERIFF Republican http://127.0.0.1:8000/reports/44/

What character encodings are used in the files from various vendors we're parsing?
Test internationalization via unicode/utf8 data.

Add a database field ("slug"?) for a unique nickname for a Contest or Choice, and use it
 in the __str__ method
Don't re-sort audit_units after adding each one in models/select_units!

Provide a way to read in, serialize, save and restore election metadata
 which is not covered by the normal data imports.
 Via Meta class and a settings save/restore
 function based on fixtures or dumpdata?

 Contest: overall_margin, proportion, confidence, selected, nickname
 CountyElection: name random_seed, 
 Batch: ballots, notes
 Choice: nickname

Provide ways to incorporate late-arriving ballots (provisional,
UOCAVA, delayed signature verification, etc)
 Allow additional batches to be read in and used to:
  1) adjust the margin and highlight any audit units from the original
   set that now need to be added to the audit
  2) separate the new batches out and allow them to be independently
   audited as a separate stage, with a new random seed.

Add selection order sequence number to /selections/<id>/ report
to make it easier to "Select the top xx audit units."

Add winnerVotes() and loserVotes() methods to contestbatch ?and margin()?
 or a way to get a list of AuditUnit objects?  or 2d array?

Normalize contest selection thresholds so sum of all thresholds is 100%

views.py results(): implement parameter or more flexible way to limit
number of audit units per contest
Include option to do smarter audit using 1% of audit units ala CA,
 and including every contest

Add election data timestamp field (e.g. for reports ala EML report)
 e.g. from file timestamp of last data file parsed.

Vote counts view as EML 510: Election Markup Language:
 how to handle over, under; how to report #ballots, #contest ballots, batch type
 selected-for-audit, notes, desired confidence, error bound, 
 include stylesheet and reference at canonical url
 produce clean, standard HTML output
 do an xslt for listing candidates across the table
 support more than 4 countmetrics (or 2 for TotalVotes) in the xslt
 style the generated HTML with css
 support parties/AffiliationIdentifiers in eml510
 why test for validvotes < 1 in xslt?
Parse election results as EML
Produce audit results as EML with discrepancies, selection algorithms & seed

Add test contest with zero margin, and check for errors, e.g. in contest selection
Select all contests with margin less than x for audit

Add test cases for EML, Hart (csv), Sequoia (txt) format and swdb (dbf) format.
Add --subtract option for Sequoia cumulative reports + parsing for batch ballots

Track and report on audit unit information: storage location, which
scanner was used, which operator, etc.

Make wpm an option, either per-contest or per-report or something.
Beware multiple defaults, for "wpm" in models.py and for "s" in stats()

Document parsers.py better - why not just make a new audit unit for each choice?
 just more efficient?   No need to worry about empty au's pushed first?
catch and print useful information about parser errors, e.g. /home0/srv/s/electionaudits/debug/nounder.out
 file name and line number of file being parsed
 what is being looked for
 xml context
 electionaudits version number, revision
 how to procede, report bugs, etc.

Declare licenses - "Ohloh searches the source code for individual
license declarations. Ohloh didn't find any such declarations in this
project's source code."

 Negexp says:
    w = 8.65617024533
    largest probability =  0.75
    smallest probability =  0.75
    expected number of precincts audited =  0.75
    expected workload =  22.5 votes counted

Tag election data with universal identifiers for contests, elected officials etc
ala sunlight labs, for linking to contribution data, etc

Produce a report of contests audited, with # units audited, results,
 whether audit was full or just incidental, local or regional, etc.
 Date and time of initial publication of vote counts, random selection,
 and each hand count.

Add documentation to audit pages, and EML: list of canvass board
 members, instructions for hand counters, standards for interpreting
 votes on ballots, relevant laws, etc.

setup.py advice - check this out:
 If your project contains django templates, set the zip_safe property to False. 
 http://justinlilly.com/blog/2009/jul/05/6-things-learned-about-setuptools/

Add total # ballots to cache args

Improve build/packaging to include dates and release numbers in README, etc.
and to automate upload procedure and reserve best practice in what
to say in each of the many release info fields.

Parse subdirectories e.g. in incoming for windows.  handle zips, and globs also?

Get NEGEXP thresholds right for contests with proportion less than 100%
and then start using true NEGEXP, rather always selecting top n races,
where n is the predicted number of audit units.

Need new seed if you count provisionals after doing original choices.
Need a way to mark which seeds go with which batches.  Use new CountyElection in a pinch?
Want multiple reporting phases which stay separate
 => Introduce EML language around Events?  And link batches to events,
 maybe as well as CountyElection, for reporting?
Or rename CountyElection to be ElectionPhase or ElectionStratum,
 add another overarching set of Events related to aggregating
 vote counts and auditing?
Look at Sequoia's data model when it comes out?

use 'auth' template variable to add urls for adding notes, admin links, etc
get access to 'request' template variable via
TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
    'django.core.context_processors.request',
from django.template import ContextRequest
return render_to_request('home.html', {}, context_instance=RequestContext(request))
{% ifequal request.path "/" %}...

Find synergy with Humboldt Transparency Project?  E.g. manage
ballot-by-ballot audits in which multiple people independently
evaluate given sets of ballots.

Use dict constructor instead of class Bunch in management command
views: get values from vars() for render_to_response rather than making
a custom dict
Is there a way to access all object attributes in a template, including docstrings?

Add number of counts also

Let visitors sort in various ways to find outliers, and make recommendations
on what should be targeted

Apply the Second-digit Benford's Law Test for fraud (Mebane et al)

Add overall total of contest votes to report.html

If only one contestant, report 100% margin

Spell threshold right in models....

Do function to mark selected audit units - ask for confirmation?
  top x batches, sorted like report view(?)

try just allocating budget of counting x% of votes to all races,
(or separately for state and local) and figuring out what best
confidence level you can get.  Probably still need to limit really
close races.

Add "audited" field
Show "targeted", and don't show confidence for targeted races, but yes for margin
also list margin by votes, as well as percent?
Add note defining margin for auditing

Add "results" field(s) to contestbatch - sum of absolute diffs for each choice?

New view to produce tally forms for selected contests: /batch/batch#/contest#/
 Election name Tally batchid, scan batch id, date, start/finish times, count #
 Unique id number for tracking sheet?
 "Office use only" for data entry, maybe discrepancies, etc
 Names of people doing the counting: vote counter and recorder.
 Race title, Choices - YES/NO/Under/Over/Not-On-Ballot
 sums by row and column, grand total that they should check with tally batch summary sheet
 Some way to simplify data entry: bar codes to pop the right entry screen?
 Scheduling system that pops out new forms for new batches when old ones are
 returned?

Data entry form for tally results

Some way to deal with custody of tally sheets and secure comparisions to
original vote.  E.g. have a system where after folks complete a tally,
they can come enter their data and compare it to the expected results.
Really want scan-batch-level results for that.

Print instruction sheet for hand counting

Add a little explanation (calculator?) view for SSR, and link to it from each
random number.
Do the same for NEGEXP thresholds.  Print the value of "w".

Incorporate more batch info: associated precinct, sub-batches (scan batches) etc

If there is no seed yet for /selection/ reports, note that fact.
Generate index.html title from election name
Make some of the text conditional for development vs publication

Add timestamps, version info to pages

Control audit report with GET params for sorting, masking results etc

Use custom view for more efficiently sorted audit report detail and report.html
no inner nested query loop contestbatch.votecount_set.all|dictsort:"choice.name"
Separate out Contests by CountyElection in audit report
Don't assume, or check, that audit report rows are all in the same sequence
Put Under, Over at end
Allow user to sort them by winner or alphabetically
combine/merge based on total ballots

Figure out how to include MBB ballot counts (CVRs) in batch?
 from pdf: pyPdf or pdftotext: Total Number of Voters : 568 of 170,066 = 0.33%
  But note that that doesn't provide ballot counts by type!
  So e.g. if a batch has both ED and EV votes, may need to just apportion
  all of them to one type for now, search for zeros later, and reapportion then

 Use csv report?  or excel?
 Based on president, or max of all contests?
 nope: there is no contest that everyone can vote on -
   e.g. a dozen absentee landowners can vote on property taxes but can't vote
   for president in Boulder County
 too bad @ballots_cast != 'Total Number of Voters' from pdf?

 Samples for Hart Tally cumulative pdf files:
 in the unix shell:
 for i in j*.pdf; do echo -n $i " " ;  pdftotext -l 1 $i /tmp/ptt; grep 'Total Number of Voters' /tmp/ptt; done > ../ballots-j

 in python:
 from pylab import array
 bal = open("../ballots-j", "r").readlines()
 bala = array([l.replace(",", "").split() for l in bal])


In new custom report view add column for selection, highlight selected
Error for -s with only one batch?
report.html: Incorporate style="text-align: right;" into css
Add a BASE HREF item?  add site_media?
Get /media/* working (css, xsl) for runserver:
 Permission denied: /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/media/
Make home page link in base.html more portable - relative, and useful
 for use from templates at different depths in hierarchy
  use named url somehow?
  make it a setting?  BASE HREF?  wget --base?
  and may need help with /admin or /media links also
  http://groups.google.com/group/django-users/browse_thread/thread/97e65f6da4009407

in eml510.xml, replace stylesheet with one from media for better performance:
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="../../media/xsl/ea510_style.xsl"?>

add digital signature to eml reports

Put explanatory notes (e.g. about margins) in FAQ or help html,
and add link from report, reports, etc

Set sequence of Choices on first save

cache Contest.stats()
parsers: cache election, batch and contest lookups for better speed

Get --contest working again
Add custom combining/merging of contestbatches post-parse

Deal better with "Not enough ballots for privacy" at end of input for a contest
 complain more loudly, prompt user for OK?
 Save temp db record for next input batch?

Provide help for selecting contests weighted by inverse margin up to 1/.005

Check out generating this message because of entry in admin after reboot:
 403 Forbidden Cross Site Request Forgery detected. Request aborted.

Validation: Should dtd url be in DOCTYPE?  Add character encoding?
What about eml510 output?

http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc/#Slide0250
 if you decide to omit the XML declaration you should choose either
 UTF-8 or UTF-16 as the encoding for the page.


We have synergy between selections for different contests to count multiple
contests on same batch, using NEGEXP, setting probability for each batch,
and using same random number for the batch for all contests.
Make that feasible with privacy protection:
 Need to combine batches the same way across contests, or refer to other contestbatches.
 Combine based on overall batch size?  Or based on min of all races??
  And mask small numbers, to be revealed in combination with others later on?

Make sure logic for combining ballots counts in AuditUnit is right for
both subtract and normal privacy combination, and think thru the latter
in light of questions about canvass of ballot styles.

Find a way to distinguish paper from dre batches and not combine them
 add option ala "don't combine if batch letter 14 is different"
 or general RE logic to compare batch names?

Append batchid to type, not batch, for csv input?
Peel it off of file name for xml?

parsers.py: accept xml precinct reports also
Parse data from San Diego - easy csv format in Election Night Results Export.zip
 http://www.sdcounty.ca.gov/voters/Eng/rov_highlights.shtml

Add version number to database, check it, maybe auto-convert.
Make it easy to run with debug but no other dependencies.
 And perhaps no sql logging?
Report 500 errors better, e.g. http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/638/

Provide a way to save all audit reports for publication from another server.
Provide secure timestamps via online timestamp server
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping
Do some sort of simple signature via keyed hash based on settings.SECRET_KEY?

Need a logo.  e.g.
  magnifying glass looking at a checkmark
  http://whtalk.blogspot.com/2008/07/citizens-audit-completed-in-enfield.html
  a grid of checkboxes, with some of them randomly selected and
   colored/highlighted/focussed/whatever - colored magnifying glass?
  Green eyeshades?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_eyeshade

Get setup.py sdist to create empty "incoming" directory; delete DELETEME.txt

Add pdf file name to batch model
Add xml file modification date to batch model
Add link to pdf file in report.html or batch.html
Add links to batches in report.html

new approach, user interface: move files from "incoming" to "processed"
 and directories....  all at end?  and keep timestamp
view /parse/ with get keywords for not sorted, not incremental
 do really long test for timeouts
 display files in sorted order
 shows what is in "incoming" directory, and moves all but last one to
 "processed" directory which is also shown
 maybe via another directory until done   for --subtract, etc
 --chronological: track high-water mark, and show error given out-of-order run
 improve feedback somehow: show progress (javascript?)

Generate different random numbers for contests than for contest list
 Incorporate contest number into the batch sequence number?
 Use 00 for contest list?

Avoid overuse and contention for batches by selecting a new one after
it has been assigned for 10 or more audit units?  Needs to be fully
automatic.  Perhaps best to audit different batches for different small races,
if looking for suppression of ballot counts in some races and using
ballot style statistics to detect that.  [how would that help?]

Or reuse batches for narrowest elections, and for next narrowest, etc
with a guarantee of looking at 5% of ballots, or 5% of batches?
 For Boulder, many wide races could mean just one batch, 65 audits, 0.2%
  One very tight race and select all races could mean 65 different batches, 11%

Plot data about the election:
 scatterplot of margins and contest_ballots sizes for different batches

Allow user to specify WPM (the "s" parameter to stats()) to views,
and/or allow for WPM to apply to batch ballot count rather than contest_ballots,
and/or to use Stark's method of dealing with WPM.

Do more rigorous statistics when proportion is not 100%, given better
information about audit units around the state.


Advise user to use django.middleware.gzip.GZipMiddleware if deploying
on public site.

set USE_ETAGS=True ?

Ad-hoc form: add text box with list of contest sizes, or size*x
 or offer common size distributions
   Minnesota, Colorado, Boulder, California, San Mateo, 

Customize admin login screen to refer to help/README and initial
credential creation, along with how to remove those hints for a public site.

Display header rows more compactly and clearly in reports.html
Avoid repeating footnote text - make an include or template tag or the like.

How to package django-based windows apps so they are easier to use?
Try http://www.python.org/doc/2.5/dist/postinstallation-script.html
and look at Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS).
Any way to get a windows GUI interface to manage.py?

Handle argument of *.xml in windows also - expand it myself with glob?

Add tests, e.g. output from varsize.py

To help with targetted selection by runner-up, display margin for each
audit unit, and flag outliers.

Make upgrades easier.
Ask user where they want the database to be [must do very early on]
 or put in Documents
Do .bat file for path, with path %PATH%;__dir__??
set pythonpath with __file__ in manage.py?

Test with python 2.6

ability to track what has been selected for audit
Add a way to calculate stats given what was audited, according to Stark
and PPEBWR or whatever.
Add separate report of audited stuff, with hand count results
Use clearer error message for duplicate data entry

Support contests with multiple winners, instant runoff voting, etc
(Already supports Approval voting)

Separate parsers.py and util.py from django dependencies - use plugins?
look thru pylint advice
perhaps automatically generate doc and put in doc directory before packaging
auto-update README on web site

Use django choices for batch.type(?)
Add info about file arguments to auto-usage message

Perhaps for anonymity, print "few" rather than a number less than 3?

Provide variant methods of combining batches for privacy (class Push)
 really want to deal with entropy of results, not number
 preserve more audit units: try to only combine small units together
 can also generate a different CountyElection with more or less detail

While parsing xml, track unrecognized FormattedValue fields - dump
 FieldName, value and line

Develop view /<countyelection>/<contest>/auditreport:
 including just batches that are in the county

Add "audited" flag (selected, success, or failure with notes?)
 and form to mark them off
 or blank report for entering numbers.  timestamps?
 want audit results report by contest - flag discrepancies.  do stats??
 perhaps also progress flags - selected, fetched, counting, done, recheck
 and update stats
Provide report of just contestbatches selected for audit
Set template LANGUAGE_CODE or report or fix html errors in databrowse base.html

Put contest abbreviation in a new field, option to print with it or not

Add features to record canvassing work: tracking number of ballots
printed, distributed, counted via each method, provisionals, and other
aspects of ensuring that the right set of votes were counted.

for --contest, don't create other contests in AuditUnit.__init__()

Procedure
=========

Improve clarity of user interface.  Put together a wizard or the like
to lead auditors thru the PROCEDURE steps from the README

    * Parse incoming data files
    * Audit reports
    * Audit selections using the random seeds for the election
    * Audit results

Packaging:
==========
Currently for each new release:
 make sure version number is updated in setup.py
 make sure README, web page and other docs are in sync and labeled with version
 run tests
 check web page validations (as part of test?)
 check bzr diff
 bzr ls --versioned | sed 's/^/include /' > MANIFEST.in
 python setup.py egg_info -b .dev-r64 sdist   # for development build
 python setup.py sdist       	      	      # for release build
 #maybe manually delete incoming/DELETME.txt
 i=ElectionAudits-0.9  # or whatever it made in dist/ minus extensions
 tar -C /tmp -zxf /srv/s/electionaudits/trunk/dist/$i.tar.gz
 cd /tmp/$i/root
 time ./manage.py test electionaudits         # and keep a record

 deploy on demo site
 commit changes in bzr
 scp -p dist/$i.tar.gz bcn:public_html/electionaudits/download/
 gpg --sign $PWD/dist/$i.tar.gz
 gpg --sign --armor --detach-sign $PWD/dist/$i.tar.gz
 echo $PWD/dist/$i.tar.gz
 echo $PWD/dist/$i.tar.gz.asc

 register new release at https://edge.launchpad.net/electionaudits/trunk
 generate gpg signature
 add download files for tar.gz, gpg signature, README
 ToDo?

 scp /home/neal/eatrunk/doc/index.html bcn:public_html/electionaudits/


Do it via the launchpad api:
 http://news.launchpad.net/api/recipe-for-uploading-files-via-the-api

Why does the order of auditunits sometimes change in the test?

Make it easy to deploy via EC2, etc.
Package up, as an egg?  And submit to http://pypi.python.org/pypi
Package for Ubuntu?

use unique settings.SECRET_KEY, ala django_extensions: generate_secret_key.py
set up time zone?

Avoid dependency on setuptools version 0.6c9 to run (even to display help)
take out bzr dependencies for users
Include data files
Try to get windows egg
How to get "pure" package, not platform-dependent?
Get setup.py to create root directory in a demo script directory, not lib

maybe switch from __file__ to resource management system for packaged data files
 ala  http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs#resource-management
  from pkg_resources import Requirement, resource_filename
  filename = resource_filename(Requirement.parse("MyProject"),"sample.conf")
 but that won't take care of location for dev.db DATABASE_NAME

Parse xml files that have been compressed with e.g. zip
easy_install --editable projectname==dev
add setup.py --test and doctest support: wrapping tests in TestSuite

look at output during easy_install of lxml

setup.py register sdist bdist_egg upload --sign

add trove classifiers to setup.py, e.g. via Jafo's mkpkg.py
 http://www.tummy.com/journals/entries/jafo_20100302_003614

describe how to host on google app engine

NOTE
====
In primary elections, when there may be multiple contests with the same
name per election (one for each party) the contest name extracted in
parsers.py needs to include the party name.
