<h1>Boulder County 2008 General Election Audit</h1>

<p>The Boulder County Elections Division broke new ground in Colorado and
the nation by doing one of the first audits that adhered to the
<a href="http://electionaudits.org/principles/">"Principles and Best Practices for Post-Election Audits"</a>.</p>

<p>It was also perhaps the most extensive "risk-limiting" audit to date,
including 13 contests from the general election.  Risk-limiting audits
are specifically designed to reduce the risk of certifying an
incorrect outcome in an election.  When the margin of victory in a
race is wide, that means that there would have to be problems with a
large number of votes to change the outcome.  So we don't have to look
at many batches of votes to detect that.  But if the margin is small,
we have to look more closely.  Traditional audits look at the same
percentage of votes in each contest.  Risk-limiting audits shift the
effort according to the margin of victory and are thus more efficient
and effective.</p>

<p>
Note that these data do not include provisional ballots.
Also, for contests that weren't entirely within Boulder County,
the data reported here for "Overall Margin" and "Proportion" of the vote
are best-effort estimates.  Unfortunately Colorado does not gather
such data until after results are certified, and information on
undervotes and overvotes, which are necessary for accurate audit margins and
selections, are rarely easy to obtain from other counties.
