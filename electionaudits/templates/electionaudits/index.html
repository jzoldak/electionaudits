<p>The contests to audit and audit units are selected based on weighted thresholds that depend on the inverse of the margin of victory (for contests) or the number of ballots voted (for audit units).   The "Sum of Square Roots" pseudorandom number generator with a random seed generated by throwing dice, is combined with the Contest or Batch sequence numbers to generate a random number for
each contest or audit unit, which is then compared to the threshold.  The larger the threshold in comparison to the random number, the more likely it is to be selected.  The "Priority" is the thresshold divided by the random number and the audit selections are presented in decreasing order by priority.

<p>
Note that for contests that weren't entirely within Boulder County,
the data reported here for "Overall Margin" and "Proportion" of the vote
are best-effort estimates.  Unfortunately Colorado does not gather
such data until after results are certified, and information on
undervotes and overvotes, which are necessary for accurate audit margins and
selections, are rarely easy to obtain from other counties.
