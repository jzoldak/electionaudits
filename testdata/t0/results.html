    <h2>Audit Results Report</h2>

<h3>Selected Audit Units</h3>


<p>A total of 2 audit units were selected for the audit.
Some audit units were randomly selected, as part of a contest
that was randomly selected for a risk-limiting audit.  Other audit units
were manually targeted as being of interest for a particular reason.
The manually targeted units are listed after all the randomly selected ones.
</p>
<p>The randomly selected units were chosen according to a plan that
incorporated the auditing statistics described
on the Contest pages (linked to from each audit unit).  It selected
the appropriate number of units for each selected contest randomly,
but with their chance of selection proportional to their size (the number of
"contest ballots" - ballots on which the contest appeared).  That was
done as follows.
First, election officials came up with the following 15 rolls of 10-sided dice:
<strong>123456789012345</strong>.
The random selection was then based on the "<i>Sum of Square Roots</i>"
pseudorandom number generator, using the dice throws for the random seed value.
That means that you can check each and every step that led from the 
statistics and dice throws to the final selections with a simple calculator.
