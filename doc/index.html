<h1>ElectionAudits software</h1>

<p>The ElectionAudits software project provides software and
documentation in support of
the <a href="http://electionaudits.org/principles">
 Principles and Best Practices for Post-Election Audits</a>
and the other work of <a href="http://electionaudits.org/">
 ElectionAudits.org</a>,
 the nation's clearinghouse for election audit information.
</p>

<p>
Get more background on the need for auditing, and the rollout of this software
at <a href="http://neal.mcburnett.org/blog/2008/10/18/electionaudits-software-help-audit-election/">ElectionAudits software - help audit the election!</a></p>
<p>
The Boulder County elections division is planning to use it for auditing
the 2008 general election.  It was developed based on
<a href="http://mcburnett.org/neal/elections/2008-boulder-primary-audit/">experiences auditing the 2008 Primary</a>.
</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>

<p>ElectionAudits helps with several facets of the task of auditing elections:</p>

<ul>
<li>Imports standard election report files</li>
<li>Protects voter anonymity by combining results for very small precincts or
batches into larger audit units.</li>
<li>Enables audits of central-count systems and mail-in ballots
without requiring that the paper ballots be sorted into piles by precinct.
Works with election systems which can't produce batch results, by
importing full election results for each batch and subtracting the result
for the previous batch from the current batch.</li>
<li>Facilitates risk-limiting audits by calculating relevant statistics
based on the margin, number, size, and results of the audit units.
Support for PPEBWR, SAFE, and NEGEXP is provided, with more on the
drawing board.</li>
<li>Ad-hoc query form lets you quickly enter information about hypothetical
contests and get selection statistics for them also.  This supports
planning for future audits, e.g. deciding how many batches to report
on so as to minimize the fraction of the ballots you'll have to audit.</li>
<li>Helps candidates target unusual audit units for elective audit [planned]</li>
<li>Convenient platform for publication and archiving of auditable reports
for the public.</li>
<li>Reports "bins" next to audit units to speed random selection with dice.
[planned]</li>
</ul>


<p>
The initial software is written in Python and uses
the Django web framework to display results either locally or globally.
It is open source, still in very active
"alpha" development.

<h2>News</h2>

<p>Major news is published at <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/electionaudits/+announcements">News and Announcements</a>, which has Atom and RSS feeds</p>

<p>You can follow development more closely at the project's Launchpad.net site:
<blockquote>
<a href="https://launchpad.net/electionaudits">https://launchpad.net/electionaudits</a>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the place to follow announcements, download releases,
file bugs, get the latest
revisions of the source code, make contributions, etc.
</p>
The first focus of development was to deal with the "batching" problem for
central-count systems.  So the software program can parse
a series of detailed "cumulative"
election reports from the Hart system, one per batch of ballots.  It
then subtracts one from another and generates the results for each
batch in an auditable report.</p>

<p>The <a href="README">README</a> file talks about what you need to
install and run the software.
</p>
<p>Here is a demo site to show what the automatically generated web
site looks like:

<blockquote>
<a href="http://neal.mcburnett.org/electionaudits/demo/">ElectionAudits demo site</a>
</blockquote>

Start with the <a href="http://neal.mcburnett.org/electionaudits/demo/reports/">Audit Reports</a> page.

<p>
If for some reason that site is down or overloaded (caching and query
optimization is still needed, but will be pretty easy), you can see
these older static pages. But note that you can't click on the links
in each of these sample pages - these are just pulled out of the live
site.
</p>

<p>First a list of contests in Boulder:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="AuditTools.html">AuditTools.html</a>
</blockquote>
<p>And second, an "auditable report" for one of those contests.  There
are only two batches there so far, since I don't have much test data
yet, but you get a sense for what it looks like:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="AuditTools-report.html">AuditTools-report.html</a>
</blockquote>
<p>You should note how much easier it is to deal with than the
crystalreports xml format that Hart generates, and which this software starts with.  Note that this example is big!
