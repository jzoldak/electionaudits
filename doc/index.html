<h1>ElectionAudits software</h1>

<p>The ElectionAudits software project provides open source software and
documentation in support of
the <a href="http://electionaudits.org/principles">
 Principles and Best Practices for Post-Election Audits</a>
and the other work of <a href="http://electionaudits.org/">
 ElectionAudits.org</a>,
 the nation's clearinghouse for election audit information.
</p>

<p>
It was used in the official
<a href="http://bcn.boulder.co.us/~neal/elections/boulder-audit-08-11/">
 Boulder County 2008 General Election Audit</a>, which was written up as
<a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2008/nov/26/new-election-audit-targets-close-races/">
 one of the first risk-sensitive audits.</a>
An overview, the audit procedure, and detailed reports and results can be found at the site.
</p>

The "ToDo" file in the
<a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~nealmcb/electionaudits/trunk/files">latest development version</a> also gives the latest insights into how you can
contribute.

<h2>Features:</h2>

<p>ElectionAudits helps with several facets of the task of auditing elections:</p>

<ul>
<li>Imports standard election report files</li>
<li>Protects voter anonymity by combining results for very small precincts or
batches into larger audit units.</li>
<li>Enables audits of central-count systems and mail-in ballots
without requiring that the paper ballots be sorted into piles by precinct.
Works with election systems which can't produce batch results, by
importing full election results for each batch and subtracting the result
for the previous batch from the current batch.</li>
<li>Facilitates risk-limiting audits by calculating relevant statistics
based on the margin, number, size, and results of the audit units.
Support for various selection procedures, including NEGEXP and many aspects of PPEBWR
and SAFE, is provided, with more on the drawing board.</li>
<li>Implements "Sum of Square Roots" (SSR) Pseudorandom Sampling Method,
which allows the entire set of selections for both contests and
audit units with a contest to be automated based on a truly random
seed value generated from dice throws.  The selections are easy for the
public to verify.</li>
<li>Convenient platform for publication and archiving of auditable reports
for the public.</li>
<li>Ad-hoc query calculator form lets you quickly enter information about hypothetical
contests and get selection statistics for them also.  This supports
planning for future audits, e.g. deciding how many batches to report
on so as to minimize the fraction of the ballots you'll have to audit.</li>
<li>Helps candidates target unusual audit units for elective audit [planned].</li>
</ul>

<p>
The software is written in Python and uses
the Django web framework to display results either locally or globally.
It is licensed as open source under the "MIT" license
and is still in very active development.

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Here is a demo site to show what the dynamically generated web
site looks like:

Start with the <a href="http://neal.mcburnett.org/electionaudits/demo/reports/">Audit Reports</a> page.

<p>
You can also see real election data at the official
<a href="http://bcn.boulder.co.us/~neal/elections/boulder-audit-08-11/">
Boulder County 2008 Audit</a> site.  That site is a copy of the
dynamic pages generated by ElectionAudits.

<h2>What you need</h2>

<p>The <a href="README">README</a> file talks about what you need to
install and run the software.

</p>
The first focus of development was to deal with the "batching" problem for
central-count systems.  So the software program can parse
a series of detailed "cumulative"
election reports from the Hart system, one per batch of ballots.  It
then subtracts one from another and generates the results for each
batch in an auditable report.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the "crystalreports" xml format that Hart's Tally software
generates, which is one of the input formats ElectionAudits parses.
It is a "cumulative" report with totals for each race, and is about a megabyte long.

</blockquote>

<p>Here is an example of the comma-separated-values (csv) format
that San Mateo county uses, which
ElectionAudits can also parse.  There is one line per precinct per candidate,
with columns for total votes, absentee votes, early votes, and election
(in-precinct) votes, among others.
