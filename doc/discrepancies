Suppose you want to allow an overstatement by k errors and still
certify, and the smallest precinct has b ballots.

The total number of ballots in the race is T.

The overall margin in votes is M.

We are using WPM = 0.2 (but don't tell Howard).

U = 2*WPM*T/M.

Initial confidence level for NO errors is 1-alpha.

Revised confidence level is

1 - exp(log(alpha)*(1-U*k/b)/(1-k/b))

Example:

Cartoon of City of Lafayette 2A

R code:

alpha <- 0.25;  # 75% confidence
WPM <- 0.2;
k <- 2;
b <- 100;  # false--this will need some thought for b=1.
T <- 12000;
M <- 0.08*T;


U <- 2*WPM*T/M;

confNew <- 1 - exp(log(alpha)*(1-U*k/b)/(1-k/b));

confNew   # 72%

####  more realistic:  one vote off in a precinct of 30 votes using WPM = 0.2
b <- 30;
k <- 1;
confNew <- 1 - exp(log(alpha)*(1-U*k/b)/(1-k/b));
confNew  [.685 = 68%]


####  code to find the confidence level given the observed discrepancies.
[R code:]

b <- rep(100,100);  #  this should get the vector of the number of
votes by batch
u <- WPM*2*b;       #  Philip says this should get a rigorous error
bound instead...
e <- rep(1,100);      # this should get the vector of the number of
margin overstatement errors

q <- max(e/u);        # maximum overstatement of the margin observed
in any batch

confNew <- 1 - exp(log(alpha)*(1-U*q)/(1-q));
confNew   # .7118
