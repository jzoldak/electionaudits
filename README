Requirements
============

Python (developed with python version 2.5, but should work with 2.3)
lxml (xml parsing package, e.g. python-lxml in Ubuntu or easy_install lxml)
Django 1.0  (parsers.py could be separated out from this pretty easily)
sqlite3

Helpful but optional Django apps used in settings.DEBUG mode:
    lukeplant_me_uk.django.validator for automatic xhtml validation
    django_extensions - for ease in development and documentation
    debug-toolbar: http://github.com/robhudson/django-debug-toolbar/tree/master

Comment them out of root/settings_debug.py and
electionaudits/urls.py if you don't want them.

It has been tested on Ubuntu Linux, but shouldn't be hard to get
running on OSX or Windows.


Versions, Bug reports
=====================
The software uses launchpad.net for project support.  Visit

 https://launchpad.net/electionaudits

to get the latest version or report bugs.  It uses the bzr ("Bazaar")
distributed version control software, making it easy for you to
contribute.

Initialization
==============

Once, when you first install or upgrade the software, you need to
initialize the database:

$ cd root
$ ./manage.py syncdb

In Windows leave off the "./":

C:> cd root
C:> manage.py syncdb

When it asks: 

 "You just installed Django's auth system, which means you don't have
 any superusers defined.  Would you like to create one now? (yes/no)"

answer "yes" and provide a username and password for the "admin" system.
Provide a valid email address also, though it won't be used unless
you customize things.

Usage
=====

parse
=====
Use the manage.py parse command to parse election results data into easily
manipulated databases and clean csv files.

Use the --help option to print usage instructions:

$ ./manage.py parse --help

In Windows leave off the "./":

C:> manage.py parse --help

Test data is provided, so you can just run

$ ./manage.py parse -s ../testdata/t0/*.xml

In Windows:

C:> manage.py parse

C:> manage.py parse -s ..\testdata\t0\*.xml

C:> cd ..\testdata\t0
C:> ..\..\root\manage.py parse -s 000<tab> 001<tab>  #auto-complete with tab

Use "manage.py reset electionaudits" to clear the database before
trying to re-enter data.

Currently supported input formats:

 * Hart InterCivic Tally "cumulative" reports in xml (crystal-reports)
   format (including all options: Absentee, Early and Election day, and
   the info box)

   One file per cumulative batch of input.  Use the "-s" option to
   "manage.py parse" to subtract each cumulative report from the previous one.

   Examples: testdata/t0/*.xml

 * CSV input with one line per candidate using these headers:
   'Precinct_name'
   'Contest_title'
   'Party_Code'
   'candidate_name'
   'cand_seq_nbr'
   'absentee_votes'
   'early_votes',
   'election_votes'
 
  and these columns, only used for 1st candidate (when 'cand_seq_nbr' is 1)
    'absentee_under_votes'
    'absentee_over_votes'
    'early_under_votes',
    'early_over_votes',
    'election_under_votes'
    'election_over_votes'

  Examples: testdata/t1.csv


web server
==========

This provides a web-based graphical user interface for exploration,
reporting and even entry of information.  It is built on the Django
framework.

Usage:

First run the internal django server:

$ cd root
$ ./manage.py runserver

This will remain running until you kill it with ctrl-c or close the window.
It will show each web page you visit.

Then, in a browser, visit the main URL, e.g.

 http://127.0.0.1:8000/

to see the Audit Reports for the various Contests, etc.


See http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ (using the username and password
you entered during the "syncdb" step) to enter new data, and
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/doc/ for more documentation on the data models
and various available views of the information.


See doc/model_graph.png for a diagram of the various database tables
and associated fields and relationships.


Features:
=========

If you install the django html validator app
lukeplant_me_uk.django.validator and use debug settings
  manage.py runserver --settings settings_debug
the server will do self-validation of all xhtml pages generated.
You can then see a report of any errors at

 http://127.0.0.1:8000/validator/
