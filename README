The ElectionAudits software project is designed to help audit
elections with good statistical confidence.  It is provided in support
of the

 Principles and Best Practices for Post-Election Audits
 http://electionaudits.org/principles

Features:
=========

It helps with several facets of the task of auditing elections:

 * Imports standard election report files into a simple SQL database
 * Protects voter anonymity by combining results for very small precincts or
   batches into larger audit units.
 * Enables audits of central-count systems and mail-in ballots
   without requiring that the paper ballots be sorted into piles by precinct.
   Works with election systems which can't produce batch results, by
   importing full election results for each batch and subtracting the result
   for the previous batch from the current batch.
 * Facilitates risk-limiting audits by calculating relevant statistics
   based on the margin, number, size, and results of the audit units.
   Support for PPEBWR, SAFE, and NEGEXP is provided, with more on the
   drawing board.
 * Supports augmenting dice throws with the "Sum of Square Roots" (SSR)
   Pseudorandom Sampling Method to select which audit units to audit and/or
   which contests to audit, based on margin size.
 * Ad-hoc calculator form lets you quickly enter information about hypothetical
   contests and get selection statistics for them also.  This supports
   planning for future audits, e.g. deciding how many batches to report
   on so as to minimize the fraction of the ballots you'll have to audit.
 * Provides information to help candidates, parties, or other observers
   target unusual audit units for elective audit.
 * Convenient platform for publication and archiving of auditable reports
   for the public.

The software is "Open source" via the very permissive MIT license.  It
can be used with no obligation, by anyone from elections officials, to
citizens to Election Management System vendors.

Versions, Bug reports
=====================
See launchpad.net for project support at

 https://launchpad.net/electionaudits

to download the latest version or report bugs.  It uses the bzr ("Bazaar")
distributed version control software, making it easy for you to
contribute.


Requirements
============

ElectionAudits has been tested on Ubuntu Linux and Windows, and should
run fine on Mac OS X and others.

It requires these other components:

 * Python (developed with python version 2.5, but should work with 2.3)
 * lxml (xml parsing package)
 * Django 1.0
 * sqlite3 lightweight database

Helpful but optional Django apps used in settings.DEBUG mode:

 * lukeplant_me_uk.django.validator, for automatic xhtml validation
 * django_extensions, for ease in development and documentation
 * debug-toolbar, http://github.com/robhudson/django-debug-toolbar/tree/master

If you want to run in DEBUG mode and don't have these, just comment
them out of root/settings_debug.py and electionaudits/urls.py


Installation
============

Ubuntu Linux
------------
On Linux, installation is easy.

On the Intrepid release, 8.10, you can get all the prerequisites this way:

  $ sudo apt-get install python-lxml libsqlite3-0 python-django

or install the same packages via the Synaptic Package Manager GUI.

For earlier Ubuntu releases, you'll need to get Django 1.0 from
 http://www.djangoproject.com/download/


Windows XP, and maybe Vista
---------------------------

First install a release of python 2.5 (e.g. 2.5.2, though 2.6 might
work):

 http://www.python.org/download/

Next install the official version of Django 1.0 using the simple steps
described at http://www.djangoproject.com/download/

On Windows you can use a tool like 7-zip (http://www.7-zip.org/) to
unpack the .tar.gz file, or bsdtar
(http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bsdtar.htm) for more
straightforward command-line use.

Then install lxml via setuptools:

Get and run this setuptools installer:

  http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.5/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c9.win32-py2.5.exe

You can then just run this:
  C:> easy-install lxml

Or use the MS Windows Installer for lxml that matches your version of
python at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/2.1.2, e.g.

   http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.5/l/lxml/lxml-2.1.2.win32-py2.5.exe

Finally, get the sqlite3 library DLL from
   http://www.sqlite.org/download.html

e.g. http://www.sqlite.org/sqlitedll-3_6_4.zip

Unzip it and put the .dll file with your other DLLs in
your default System directory, e.g. C:\WINDOWS\system32


Mac OS X
--------

This should be pretty easy if you search a bit, but we don't have
specific instructions.  Let us know if you want help, or if you can
share advice.


Initialization
==============

When you first install or upgrade the software, you need to
initialize the database:

$ cd root
$ ./manage.py syncdb

In Windows leave off the "./":

C:> cd root
C:> manage.py syncdb

When it asks: 

 "You just installed Django's auth system, which means you don't have
 any superusers defined.  Would you like to create one now? (yes/no)"

answer "yes" and provide a username and password for the "admin" system.
Logging in with this account, or another "staff" account, is necessary
for parsing new data files from within the web interface.

It asks for a valid email address also, but doesn't share it or use
it unless you customize things.

Usage
=====

parse
=====

You can import and parse new files in two ways: via the
http://127.0.0.1:8000/parse/ page (see below) or from the
command line.

From the command line, use the manage.py parse command to import
election results data into easily manipulated databases.

Use the --help option to print usage instructions:

$ ./manage.py parse --help

In Windows leave off the "./":

C:> manage.py parse --help

Test data is provided, so you can just run

$ ./manage.py parse -s -c ../testdata/t0

which parses all the files in that directory in chronological order.
It may take a while to run.  A brief synopsis of each contest is
printed at the end.

In Windows:

C:> manage.py parse
or
C:> manage.py parse -s -c ..\testdata\t0


Use "manage.py reset electionaudits" to clear the database before
trying to re-enter data.

Currently supported input formats:

 * Hart InterCivic Tally "cumulative" reports in xml (crystal-reports)
   format (including all options: Absentee, Early and Election day, and
   the info box)

   One file per cumulative batch of input.  Use the "-s" option to
   "manage.py parse" to subtract each cumulative report from the previous one.

   Examples: testdata/t0/*.xml

 * CSV input with one line per candidate using these headers:
   'Precinct_name'
   'Contest_title'
   'Party_Code'
   'candidate_name'
   'cand_seq_nbr'
   'absentee_votes'
   'early_votes',
   'election_votes'
 
  and these columns, only used for 1st candidate (when 'cand_seq_nbr' is 1)
    'absentee_under_votes'
    'absentee_over_votes'
    'early_under_votes',
    'early_over_votes',
    'election_under_votes'
    'election_over_votes'

  Examples: testdata/t1.csv

Planned
 * Hart "precinct" reports

Web server
==========

This provides a web-based graphical user interface for exploration,
reporting and even entry of information.  It is built on the Django
framework.

Usage:

First run the internal django server:

$ cd root
$ ./manage.py runserver

This will remain running until you kill it with ctrl-c or close the window.
It will show each web page you visit.

Then, in a browser, visit the main URL, e.g.

 http://127.0.0.1:8000/

to see the Audit Reports for the various Contests, etc.

The "Parse incoming data files" page <http://127.0.0.1:8000/parse/>
provides an alternative to the command line for importing xml data files.
It automatically selects the --subtract and --chronological options.

Just put the files in the "incoming" directory, visit that page to see
a list of the files, and click the button.  Beware that there is
currently no feedback during the import, so just be patient.

See http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ (using the username and password
you entered during the "syncdb" step) to enter new data, and
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/doc/ for more documentation on the data models
and various available views of the information.

For example, you will usually want to edit the countyelection to
specifiy the confidence level for each contest, and the overall margin
of victory if there are ballots that are outside the county.  Visit:

 http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/electionaudits/countyelection/


See doc/model_graph.png for a diagram of the various database tables
and associated fields and relationships.


Debugging
=========

You can run the test cases via this command:

 manage.py test electionaudits

If you install the django html validator app
lukeplant_me_uk.django.validator and use debug settings
  manage.py runserver --settings settings_debug
the server will do self-validation of all xhtml pages generated.
You can then see a report of any errors at

 http://127.0.0.1:8000/validator/

FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions
================================

Q: Parsing failed with a "Negative vote count" error - why?

A: When parsing xml files with the --subtract option, you need to 
make sure they are processed in sequential order, or else the
subtraction will result in negative vote counts.  If you can preserve
the modification timestamps on the files, you should be able to use the
"--chronological" option to process them in order.  But note that
various ways of copying will change the timestamps - e.g. via cp without
the "-p" option, or via bzr, or via some versions of Nautilus.

This can also happen if you read the same data in twice.  Before
re-reading data, you should clear out all vote counts in the database
with

 manage.py reset electionaudits


Q: I've forgotten the admin password and can't access staff pages!

A: See http://coderseye.com/2007/howto-reset-the-admin-password-in-django.html


Q: I forgot to get a zero cumulative xml report before reading in ballots.
What do I do now?

A: You can specify the same report as the first two cumulative
reports, and it will subtract one from the other, and not add any
audit units because everything subtracts out to be zero.
