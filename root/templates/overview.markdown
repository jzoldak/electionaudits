##Boulder does historic "risk-limiting" audits

The Boulder County Elections Division broke new ground in Colorado and
the nation by doing one of the first audits that adhered to the
["Principles and Best Practices for Post-Election Audits"](http://electionaudits.org/principles/).

It was also perhaps the most extensive "risk-limiting" audit to date,
including 13 contests from the general election.  Risk-limiting audits
are specifically designed to reduce the risk of certifying an
incorrect outcome in an election.  When the margin of victory in a
race is wide, that means that there would have to be problems with a
large number of votes to change the outcome.  So we don't have to look
at many batches of votes to detect that.  But if the margin is small,
we have to look more closely.  Traditional audits look at the same
percentage of votes in each contest.  Risk-limiting audits shift the
effort according to the margin of victory and are thus more efficient
and effective.

For example, the margin in the Lafayette 2A contest was much tighter
than in the City of Boulder's issue 2A.  So we audited 7 batches of
ballots for the Lafayette measure and 2 for Boulder's, and got the
same level of confidence for both.  That is more effective than
auditing 4 or 5 batches of votes for each race, and more efficient
than auditing 7 for each.

Boulder will be championing the use of risk-limiting auditing
procedures before the Colorado Election Reform Commission, which is
currently looking at improving audits in Colorado.

Boulder County augmented the "Random Audit" required by Colorado
law. The improved methods, pre-approved by the Secretary of State
 * compare hand counts of votes within batches against the actual counts
produced during the live election, and
 * audit all types of ballots, including mail-in ballots which
are mostly overlooked in current Colorado audits.

We audited more ballots in a single contest than ever before in
Boulder, including 13 batches of votes for the tight Longmont Question
2A race, involving 8239 ballots.

We targeted two batches for audit based on high numbers of the "phantom
votes" noted during the resolution phase of the original machine count.
In each batch we audited two contests likely to be affected, and found
no significant evidence of problems, so the special review procedures adopted
during the original count appear to have been very effective.

The overall results give us more confidence than ever in the reported results
for this election, based on the close agreement between the hand counts and
machine counts.  We did find one ballot in which an overvote was
reported as an undervote, due to a confusing user interface in the
resolution process.  The hand count results most often matched the
system count exactly, and generally differed by less than 2 votes,
which is far less than what would trigger an escalation of the
audit.

The audit also set new standards for transparency and verifiability.
All the detail on results to be audited was published on the web
before the random selection of batches to be audited was done.
Peer-reviewed procedures for ensuring verifiably random dice throws
and selections were used.  A recently published "NEGEXP" method was used
to select the batches in a way that is more efficient at detecting
problems than previous methods.

We reviewed 40047 ballots looking for votes in particular contests, which
is 0.5% of the total number of votes cast by voters in Boulder County.
This is still about half of the total number of ballots that we would
have audited using the rules in California, in which 1% of the
ballots are audited for each contest.

The audit used a new open source program, [ElectionAudits](http://neal.mcburnett.org/electionaudits/), which read
the election reports by batch, independently tallied up the batches,
and aided in the statistical analysis, random selection and publication
of the results.  Full details on the audit, the software, and the
methods used can be found at
